Description:

CarChat is a data dissemination protocol designed for a highly mobile network such as 
a vehicular wireless ad-hoc network. There are two types of nodes: vehicular nodes and 
infrastructure nodes (with ID greater than MAX_NODES)

$ make micaz sim     or     $ make telosb     
(ensure proper #define statements are commented in CarChat.h file)

This will compile the protocol for simulation or testbed deployment respectively.
in order to run a simulation, use scripts in ./test_scripts/ with corresponding input
files from ./input_files/ Then, use scripts in ./input_proc/ to parse the output of
the simulation file into usable statistics:

input_filter_*.py - This script will parse the simulation output file and print out
              a series of arrays with received data packet count for each of the nodes 
              in the network, with the first entry of each array being a timestamp.

msgCount_filter_* - This script will parse the simulation output file and print out
              a series of arrays with total counts for sent messages (advertisements,
              requests and data packets) by each node. First entry of the array will
              be a time stamp.

compl_filter_* - This script will parse the outputs of the previous two scripts and
              output a series of arrays as follows
              time_stamp | data packets held by node 1 | ... | data packets held by node N | total data traffic so far in network
